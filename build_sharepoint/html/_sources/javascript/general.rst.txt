JavaScript Intro
==================================================

Limitless possibilities
--------------------------------------------------
Modern Forms are highly customizable and it's JavaScript which allows you to go above and beyond any limitations you might face.

Bootstrap and custom styles can make your form look great on any screen and device, but JavaScript can add often much needed interactivity to the form.

Modern Forms are built with Vue.js and also support JQuery.

    - You can find general information about JavaScripts used on the form in the :doc:`Manager section </javascript/manager>`.

    - :doc:`Containers </javascript/containers>`, :doc:`Controls </javascript/controls>`, :doc:`Fields </javascript/fields>`, 
      and :doc:`SharePoint Fields </javascript/fields-sp>` sections provide detailed explaination of JS properties, methods and events for these elements.

    - Finally, check out our How-to section for practical examples of JavaScript use, 
      such as :doc:`Manipulate fields </how-to/conditional-containers>` 
      and :doc:`Manipulate containers </how-to/conditional-containers>` articles.
