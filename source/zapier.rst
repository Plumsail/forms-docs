If this is your first Zap, at this point you'll need to **Sign in to** |Plumsail Account| from Zapier, so the connection is established between the app and your account. If you already have an account tied to the app, you can add another one at this step, and use it instead.

**Important!** You can only bind Zaps to the forms that are stored in your Plumsail Account!
