Public Forms Licensing  
==================================================

*Plumsail Forms License* is necessary if you want to use Public Web Forms and subscribe to our **Plumsail Forms** Microsoft Flow connector.

Public Web Forms can be included on any webpage and with this license, you will be able to process data submitted through the form and use it in your own Flows.

This license is also needed if you want to submit data from Modern SharePoint Forms to Flow using Plumsail connector instead of default Microsoft triggers.
This will allow you to include additional fields on your SharePoint Forms which then can be handled with Flow.

*Plumsail Forms License* is an annual subscription license, but it includes **30 days Trial** period.
