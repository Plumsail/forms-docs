Public Forms Licensing  
==================================================

**Plumsail Web Forms** offer a |wide range of subscription licenses|, depending on your needs. A free version is available as well.

* All plans offer an **unlimited amount of forms** to be designed and 
  there are no limitations to how complex the forms can be, that includes the free plan as well.

* The main difference between the plans is the **amount of form submissions** available per month, as well as available temporary storage for uploaded files.

* Temporary storage of uploaded files *is automatically cleared once a month* and removes all files older than 30 days. 
  For commercial plans, **this can be done at any point** by clicking a button in the |Plumsail Account|, offering an almost limitless amount of files to be uploaded per month. 

* Only the free version comes with commercial branding by Plumsail, that includes a small link to our site on free forms. 
  Commercial plans include **no branding**. Once a commercial plan is purchased, the branding is removed.

These are all the differences, everything else is the same across all the plans. No matter which plan you choose, you will be able to design powerful forms with
any amount of fields, controls, and run custom JavaScript on your form.
