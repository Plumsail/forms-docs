Introduction to Plumsail Forms
==================================================

Responsive UI
--------------------------------------------------

Powered by Bootstrap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plumsail Forms are built using `Bootstrap v4.0.0 <https://getbootstrap.com/>`_ and as such, every element on the form, including Containers, Controls and Fields is responsive by default as is the form itself.

This is achived by using Bootstrap's grids which are used by default on every form. Plumsail Forms give you full control over layout of the elements on the form.



Publish anywhere and post data to anywhere 
--------------------------------------------------


Publish anywhere
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plumsail Forms can be added to absolutely any page on the web and their use is not limited to Sharepoint. However, this will only work with Plumsail forms, not for forms designed to work with Sharepoint.

All you need to do is design form in the designer, save it, go to your Plumsail Account Forms Section, open Forms tab, select  the form you just saved and copy widget.
This copied widget then can be added to HTML code of any page and that's all you'll need to do to get the form on the page.


Post data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the form is filled and submitted, data is handled with `Microsoft Flow <https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/>`_. You can do anything you like with it.
If you want, you can email it or parse data into Sharepoint list. It's up to you how to handle it and possibilities are nearly endless.
