Introduction to Plumsail Forms
==================================================

General information
--------------------------------------------------
Plumsail Forms allow you to design and publish elegant and highly customizable forms to any page on the web.

When user submits the form, data is handled by |Flow| and you can use for any of your needs - in conjuction with SharePoint or without it.

In order to use Plumsail Forms with Microsoft you will only need to purchase **Plumsail License** for Forms.

If you are interested in using Modern SharePoint Forms, you will also need **Forms Designer License**. 
Read more about Modern SharePoint Forms :doc:`here </introductionSP>`.


Responsive UI
--------------------------------------------------

Built with Vue, powered by Bootstrap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plumsail Forms are built using |Bootstrap| and |Vue| and as such, 
every element on the form, including Containers, Controls, and Fields is responsive by default as is the form itself and easily accessible via JavaScript.

   <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 4</a>



.. |Vue| raw:: html

   <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue.js 2</a>


This is achived by using Bootstrap's grids which are used by default on every form. Plumsail Forms give you full control over layout of the elements on the form.

You can read more about new containers and their properties :doc:`here </designer/containers>`.

Publish anywhere and post data to anywhere 
--------------------------------------------------


Publish anywhere
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plumsail Forms can be added to absolutely any page on the web and their use is not limited to SharePoint. However, this will only work with Plumsail forms, not for forms designed to work with SharePoint.

All you need to do is design form in the designer, save it, go to your Plumsail Account Forms Section, open Forms tab, select  the form you just saved and copy widget.
This copied widget then can be added to HTML code of any page and that's all you'll need to do to get the form on the page.


Post data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the form is filled and submitted, data is handled with |Flow|. You can do anything you like with it.
If you want, you can email it or parse data into SharePoint list. It's up to you how to handle it and possibilities are nearly endless.
