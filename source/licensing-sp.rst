SharePoint Forms Licensing
==================================================

*Forms for SharePoint Online License* is needed to use Modern SharePoint Forms which are responsive and are built to work with Modern SharePoint pages.

 **This license is different from our Forms Designer product license which is built to work with SharePoint classic pages.**

 *While offering similar functionality, the products are quite different in how they are built and function.*

With this license, you will be able to replace standard SharePoint List and Document Library Forms with custom made ones in our simple to use, but very powerful Modern Forms Designer.

You do not need an additional license if you do not plan on using our custom connector to submit data to Microsoft Flow.

*Forms for SharePoint Online License* is a perpetual license per Office 365 tenant and it also includes **30 days Trial** period.
