SharePoint Forms Licensing
==================================================

|SharePoint Forms for Modern UI License| is needed to replace standard SharePoint List and Document Library forms 
with custom made forms that are built to work with Modern SharePoint pages.

 **This license is different from our** |Forms Designer| **product license which is built to work with SharePoint classic pages.**

 *While offering similar functionality, the products are quite different in how they are built and function.*

You **do not need an additional license** if you do not plan on using our custom connector to submit data to Microsoft Flow.

**SharePoint Forms for Modern UI License** is a perpetual license per Office 365 tenant and it also includes **30 days Trial** period.

*1-year maintenance of Forms for SharePoint Online* is included with the license, it allows you to receive quick support and have access to the latest updates.
Maintenance expires in 1 year and can be purchased again from the |store|.
