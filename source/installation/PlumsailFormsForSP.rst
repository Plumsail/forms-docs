Plumsail Forms for Sharepoint 
==================================================


Bind your Sharepoint tenant to your Account
--------------------------------------------------
In order to bind your Sharepoint tenant to Plumsail account, you need to have permissions of tenant administrator. 
This is only necessary for installation and we are not storing or using your credentials in any way, only to get permission for installation.

Once you sign in to Plumsail Account, you'll need to go to Forms section, select licenses tab and add Sharepoint license with your domain. 
Follow all the instructed steps and once you've added Sharepoint license to your domain, you will be able to use Plumsail Forms for your lists and document libraries after completing the next step.

Install app package to your tenant

Last thing you need to do, to include Plumsail Forms on your Sharepoint sites, 
is to install `this app package <https://plumsail.com>`_ to your app catalog and distribute it to all sites or just the sites you plan to use Plumsail Forms on.
