Introduction to Modern SharePoint Forms
==================================================

Responsive UI
--------------------------------------------------
Just like Plumsail Forms, Modern SharePoint forms are built using |Bootstrap| and |Vue|.

Finally, you are able to design modern, responsive and fully customizable forms for SharePoint in just a few clicks.

Publishing forms to SharePoint pages
--------------------------------------------------

When saved, SharePoint Form will automatically replace default form for the List or Document Library. 

Differences between Plumsail Forms and classic Forms Designer
-------------------------------------------------------------

Modern SharePoint Forms will only work with Modern SharePoint pages.

There are many other differences between classic Forms Designer and Modern SharePoint Forms, not limited to use of Bootstrap or Responsive layout. 

First of all, Modern Forms use |Vue| which you can utilize to your advantage with custom scripts. JQuery is still available too.

How the fields are handled has also changed, you are no longer limited to the default SharePoint fields from the list, but you can also add your own. 

With Modern SharePoint Forms after saving an item, you also can send data using |Flow|, which you then can use to populate other lists or do anything else with it, it's up to you.
