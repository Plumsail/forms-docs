===========================================================
This article will describe how you can convert :ref:`designer-datatable` into HTML template with |Plumsail Actions|.

You can simply convert DataTable into HTML table with *Data Operations - Create HTML table* actions in MS Flow, 
this step is described in :ref:`flow-html-table` article. 

But this operation comes with limitation, primarily, you can't affect values stored in the table and the way they are displayed.

For example, you can't convert dates to a more readable format or add a dollar sign to number columns. In this article, we will do just that.
