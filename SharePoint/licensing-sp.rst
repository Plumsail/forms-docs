Licensing Information
==================================================

with custom made forms that are built to work with Modern SharePoint pages. 

The product includes **30 days Trial** after which you'll need to purchase license to continue using the product.

.. important::  **This license is different from our** |Forms Designer| **product license which is built to work with SharePoint classic pages.**

you also need to have a |Public Web Forms License| or use a free plan.
