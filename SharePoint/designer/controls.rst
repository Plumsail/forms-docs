Controls in Plumsail Forms for SharePoint
==================================================

Controls are elements designed to give you more control over your forms. They allow you to customize the look of the form and add interactivity to it. 
Controls aren't fields as they do not store information, though some controls rely on user input.

Plain Text
-------------------------------------------------------------
Plain Text control is used to add text to your form, for information that you want to convey to the user. 
Even though it's a plain text control, you can still format the text and apply styles to it.
