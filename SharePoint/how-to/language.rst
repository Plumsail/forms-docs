Plumsail Forms supports custom forms for different languages out of the box.

Implementation
--------------------------------------------------
Let's say, we have a Task List. Here's the default English form:

To add another form in another language, we only to have SharePoint Admin with different language in his profile:

   :alt: Login as German Admin

When they open the form in the editor, they will see an empty form and a Content Type in their own language (if translated):

   :alt: Editor with German Content

They can customize the form, make sure that it works for their language. 
Next time, when a user with the same language preferences opens the form, they will see the custom form for their language instead:
