About updates
--------------------------------------------------
Occasionally, we'll need to update app package for SharePoint, in order to expand product's functionality and fix any issues which may appear with SharePoint updates.

Some changes to the app package can be minor, requiring you only to update the package in App Catalog. The latest version of the package can always be found in your |Plumsail Account|.

Sometimes, the changes are major, and this will require some extra steps to update the app fully. We try to keep these updates to a minimum, only releasing them when absolutely necessary.

Update from v.1.0.4.0 or earlier
---------------------------------------------------
If you are using app package *v.1.0.4.0* or an earlier version, you might face issues with Form Panel or with List or Library control. Latest features of the app also won't be available.

To update to package *v.1.0.5.0* or later, you will also need to re-save all the forms that you have in the latest version of Plumsail Forms designer app. This will update the scripts on the page of each particular form, and fix many issues which might've been present otherwise.
