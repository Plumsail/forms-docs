Personal information: what we collect, when and how we use it

We collect information from you when you install Plumsail Forms for the first time, such as the domain names for SharePoint. 
Forms for SharePoint send all the data directly to SharePoint, we have no access to it.
All operations are performed over secure encrypted HTTPS connection. We never sell any personal info to third parties.

Installation (Office365)
-------------------------------------------------------------
When you install Plumsail Forms to SharePoint Online, you need to add your domain to Plumsail Account. 

We recommend to install the Azure Active Directory enterprise application by giving permissions to the app. The app uses them to publish forms to any site collection or site that you have on the Tenant. It enables scripting capabilities on a target site, and is the easiest and most user-friendly option there is to ensure publishing goes smoothly for any site.

.. important:: We cannot access any of the data stored on your tenant at any point, and once you've published all the forms, you can safely delete the app in AAD Admin Center (we can't remove it for you):

Alternatively, you can :doc:`enable scripting capabilities</enable-scripts>` manually.
