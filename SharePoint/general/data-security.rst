Data security
------------------------------
Plumsail Forms collects very few information about customers - 
only SharePoint Online domain name (for SharePoint License) and |Plumsail Account| email are required for license validation.

After installing Plumsail Forms, the only data that we are gathering from you is application logs from the system.

All the data submitted in SharePoint Forms, including attachments, is sent directly to SharePoint.
