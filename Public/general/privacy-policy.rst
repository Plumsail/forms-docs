Personal information: what we collect, when and how we use it
-------------------------------------------------------------
When you sign up for |Plumsail Account|, you may be asked to enter your name and email address. 
We collect information from you when you install Plumsail Forms for the first time, such as the domain names for SharePoint. 

The data submitted with Public Web Forms is by default stored in Microsoft Azure Storage (you can :doc:`disable this option </submissions>` for any form), |encrypted at REST|. It's not accessible until you login to your |Plumsail Account|, even we don't have access to the stored data. 
Attachments are always stored encrypted at REST, even if the rest of the form data is not stored. Attachments that are older than 30 days are automatically deleted. For the paid plans, this storage can be cleared at any point.

All operations are performed over secure encrypted HTTPS connection. We never sell any personal info to third parties.

Log information
-------------------------------------------------------------
We are automatically gathering some data and store it in log files. 
This information includes several activities as internet protocol addresses, browser, 
internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. 
Our application log files are subject to the same strict data security policies and procedures as apply to the application databases. 
We do this to improve the support that we offer you. Log files are stored for a few days, then they are removed permanently.

Local storage
-------------------------------------------------------------
We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage. 
Local storage is located in client web browsers. We donâ€™t transfer any data from local storage to our servers. 
It is used for performance optimization and caching. 
Like cookies, you can control how local storage works on your browser settings on a global or website specific manner. 
You can disable local storage or clear it manually at any time.

What happens to data when Forms has been uninstalled?
-------------------------------------------------------------
When you uninstall Forms, logs are removed permanently.
Local storage data can be cleared manually in your browser. 
Information about Forms downloads and installations are still stored on our servers and can be removed by request. 
You can send a request to support@plumsail.com.

How do we protect your information?
-------------------------------------------------------------
As stated above, we store information about Forms installations, downloads and log files on our servers. 
Log files are stored for a few days, then they are removed permanently. 
Our services and storages are scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible. 
Information about Forms installations and log files are contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special
access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. 
In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. 
All data transited between you and us is encrypted and sent using HTTPS.
