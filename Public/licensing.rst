Public Forms Licensing  
==================================================

**Plumsail Web Forms** offer a |wide range of subscription licenses|, depending on your needs. A free version is available as well.

For a commercial plan you can choose your billing cycle â€” purchase for one year or pay month-to-month. The subscription is linked to an email address.

Available Plans
**************************************************
All plans offer an **unlimited amount of forms** to be designed and 
there are no limitations to how complex the forms can be, that includes the free plan as well.

* Scooter (free) - 100 submissions/month, 100 MB storage (cleared monthly), 20 MB max attachment file size
* Pickup - 1,000 submissions/month, 1 GB storage (can be cleared at any point), 100 MB max attachment file size
* Van - 10,000 submissions/month, 5 GB storage (can be cleared at any point), 300 MB max attachment file size
* Truck - 1,000,000 submissions/month, 10 GB storage (can be cleared at any point), 500 MB max attachment file size

Only the free Scooter plan comes with commercial branding by Plumsail, that includes a small link to our site on free forms. 
Commercial plans include **no branding**. Once a commercial plan is purchased, the branding is removed.

Each plan works as a subscription and a free Scooter plan is the default one. 
If you pay for a Pickup, a Van or a Truck subscription, but do not prolong it after the paid period ends, you get back on the Scooter.
Scooter plan is **always free**.

Submissions
**************************************************
The main difference between the plans is the **amount of form submissions** available per month. 
When you press the Submit button on the form and you see a message *The form has been submitted successfully* - this counts as a submission.
The only exception is if you open Flow configuration in the designer and remove the check mark from *Submit Form to Flow*, in this case submissions wouldn't count.

Available submissions count is renewed every 1st day of the month.

Storage
**************************************************
Another difference for plans is **available temporary storage** for uploaded files. 
Each time a user uploads files to the Attachments field, files are saved to the temporary storage before being used in the Flow.

Temporary storage of uploaded files *is automatically cleared* on the 1st day of the month and removes all files older than 30 days. 
    
.. note::   For commercial plans, **storage can be cleared at any point** by clicking a button in the |Plumsail Account|, 
            offering an almost limitless amount of files to be uploaded per month.
