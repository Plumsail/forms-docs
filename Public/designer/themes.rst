Themes for Public Web Forms
-------------------------------------------------------------
Using themes is an easy and quick way to change coloring scheme for all Fields, Controls and Containers, as well as default font, and field borders.

Here's an example of the same form with different themes:

|pic4| |pic5|

.. |pic4| image:: ../images/designer/themes/PlumsailPurple.png
   :alt: Purple Plumsail Form Theme
   :width: 40%

.. |pic5| image:: ../images/designer/themes/PlumsailOrange.png
   :alt: Orange Plumsail Form Theme
   :width: 40%

Select one of default or create your own custom theme via **Theme Settings**:

|pic9|

.. |pic9| image:: ../images/designer/themes/designer-themes-settings.png
   :alt: Custom Theme for Plumsail Forms

In order to apply a theme, don't forget to **Save** the form!

There is an option to compare different themes in Form Preview to see how they would look on the form, including your own custom theme:

|pic10|

.. |pic10| image:: ../images/designer/themes/designer-themes-preview.png
   :alt: Form Preview with Theme Selection

You can always use additonal CSS to add more changes to the form and to further customize it for your needs.
