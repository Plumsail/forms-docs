Themes for Public Web Forms
-------------------------------------------------------------
Using themes is an easy and quick way to change coloring scheme for all Fields, Controls and Containers.

Here's an example of the same form with different themes:

|pic4| |pic5|

.. |pic4| image:: ../images/designer/themes/PlumsailPurple.png
   :alt: Purple Plumsail Form Theme
   :width: 40%

.. |pic5| image:: ../images/designer/themes/PlumsailOrange.png
   :alt: Orange Plumsail Form Theme
   :width: 40%

To adjust the theme for your Public Web form, click the Theme button in the designer:

|pic6|

.. |pic6| image:: ../images/designer/themes/ThemeButton.png
   :alt: Theme button for Plumsail Forms

You will see Theming Settings menu and here you can either select one of default themes:

|pic7| |pic8|

.. |pic7| image:: ../images/designer/themes/ThemingSettings.png
   :alt: Plumsail Form ThemingSettings

.. |pic8| image:: ../images/designer/themes/DefaultThemes.png
   :alt: Default Plumsail Form Themes

Or create your own custom theme by selecting colors (will need to wait a few minutes for custom theme to apply):

|pic9|

.. |pic9| image:: ../images/designer/themes/Custom.png
   :alt: Custom Theme for Plumsail Forms

In order to apply a theme, don't forget to **Save** the form!

There is an option to compare different themes in Form Preview to see how they would look on the form, including your own custom theme:

|pic10|

.. |pic10| image:: ../images/designer/themes/Preview.png
   :alt: Form Preview with Theme Selection

You can always use additonal CSS to add more changes to the form and to further customize it for your needs.
